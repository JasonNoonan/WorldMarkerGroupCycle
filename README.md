# Description

AddOn expanding on [World Marker Cycler](https://wago.io/koguSJAuR) by Clove.

Same basic idea, will cycle through the defined group of world markers, with keybinds for placing markers and clearing markers.

Expanded functionality includes:

1. The ability to add profiles to manage different cycle groups of world markers
   1. Example: You use `Default` to handle the normal 8-marker rotation, but `Ovinax` to rotate through just 4 markers.
1. Uses the default Blizzard keybind system to allow for more keybinding options, namely the ability to use the mousewheel as a keybind easily.
